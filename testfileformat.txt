=== bigseparator =======
--- smallseparator -----

the first two lines are for the tool
to learn what is bigseparator and smallseparator.

all the following lines will be ignored
up to the next bigseparator.
that means you can write whatever here.
maybe comments for the test cases.
or leave it empty.

the separators can be any string.
big and small separator should be different.

the actual separators used below
can have any text appended at the end.
but the start must be identical
to the separators defined above.

btw this is a legitimate testfile
try it with

    ./cgrunner.sh cat expectedoutput <testfileformat.txt

or maybe not the output is confusing lol

=== bigseparator ===================
mandatory test case title
--- smallseparator ------------------

these lines
will become input
for your code

--- smallseparator -----------------

these lines
will become the expected output

note that the empty lines count towards the result
all lines between the separators count

=== bigseparator =================
next test case title
--- smallseparator ----------------
input
--- smallseparator ---------------
expected output
=== bigseparator ======= last big separator is optional
