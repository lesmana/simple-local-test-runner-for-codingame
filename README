codingame local runner

helper to run codingame code on local machine

with test data in one file for easy editing

run like this

    ./codingamelocalrunner.sh runyourcode <testdata

this will run runyourcode with input taken from testdata

testdata is parsed to split individual test cases

compares output from your code with output taken from test data file

only works for practice puzzles that expects input just once

does not work for puzzles that expect input per turn

most likely never will because turn based input must be calculated
